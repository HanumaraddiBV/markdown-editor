## Overview

This project is a **Markdown Editor** that allows users to type Markdown on the left pane and see the real-time HTML preview on the right pane. It is built using **React** for the frontend and **Node.js** for the optional backend processing of Markdown-to-HTML conversion.

## Features

- **Real-Time Markdown to HTML Conversion**: See changes as you type.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes.
- **Optional Backend**: Convert Markdown to HTML on the backend using Node.js.
- **Animations and Syntax Highlighting**: Smooth animations and typing effects enhance the user experience.

    npm install
    
    # For the frontend (React app):
    cd ../CLIENT
    npm install
   
 ### Running the Project
  To run the project locally, start both the frontend and backend
  
    # Start the backend server:
    cd SERVER
    nodemon server.js

    # Start the React frontend:
    cd ../CLIENT
    npm start
  The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000 and the backend at http://localhost:3001.
